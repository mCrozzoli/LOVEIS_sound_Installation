LOVE IS was created to study how people engage and perceive space, using their own bodies to transform the soundscape they listen to.

In this piece, different sounds are triggered by ultrasound sensors: sounds are activated when people move around while wearing a heartbeat monitor that sends their heartbeat to a computer. This computer uses the heart rate as a number to transform the same sounds they are triggering.

When my father passed away, I remembered one of the most beautiful talks we had together about love, and what love was for him. Still today, his words are echoing in my heart. Reflecting on this memory, I thought that even though what love is, is different for every being, there is always an element of presence and strong emotionality.

Following this line of thought, I created this installation, where presence is translated into our movements around the room, and emotion is translated into the beatings of our hearts.
